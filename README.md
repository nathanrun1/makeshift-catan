Was playing Catan, had an idea for a project where I could learn both RL and C++.  This is my first time using C++ and trying out RL.

The project: Make a Catan game environment, and then use it to train an RL agent to play Catan against 1,2 or 3 other players.
The Catan game environment will be made using C++ and the standard library alone (no shortcuts for max learning).
The RL agent might be trained in Python, but I might end up coding it from scratch in C++ using only GLM or Eigen.
Progress:
- Catan game environment is fully finished and playable through the console (looking to improve on the console interface using OpenGL for some prettier graphics)
- Currently learning RL online through the Stanford RL lecture youtube videos. Once I feel that my understanding is sufficient, I'll start working on the RL part.
